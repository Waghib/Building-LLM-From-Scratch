# Building a Transformer from Scratch for Text Summarization

This project implements a transformer-based text summarization model built from scratch using PyTorch. The implementation focuses on abstractive summarization, where the model generates concise, coherent summaries while preserving key information from the input text.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a transformer architecture from scratch, focusing on text summarization. The model includes key components like multi-head attention, positional encoding, and encoder-decoder architecture, all implemented using PyTorch.

## Model Architecture

The implementation includes the following key components:

- **MultiHeadAttention**: Custom implementation of multi-head attention mechanism
- **PositionalEncoding**: Adds positional information to the input embeddings
- **PositionWiseFeedForward**: Feed-forward neural network applied to each position
- **EncoderLayer**: Complete transformer encoder layer
- **Transformer**: Full transformer architecture with encoder-decoder structure

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- PyTorch >= 2.0.0
- Transformers >= 4.30.0
- Pandas >= 1.5.0
- Scikit-learn >= 1.0.0
- Rouge-score >= 0.1.2

## Model Features

- **Custom Transformer Implementation**: Built from scratch using PyTorch
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input
- **Positional Encoding**: Maintains sequence order information
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks
- **BERT Tokenizer**: Efficient tokenization for input processing

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Training Loss
- ROUGE Scores (Rouge-1, Rouge-2, Rouge-L)
- Generated Summary Quality

## Usage

The model can be used for text summarization tasks. Here's a basic example:

```python
def generate_summary(model, src, tokenizer, max_len, device):
    model.eval()
    # Process input text and generate summary
    # See the main code for detailed implementation
```
